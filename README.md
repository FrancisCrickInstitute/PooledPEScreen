# PooledPEScreen
Accompanying code to "High-throughput screening of human genetic variants by pooled prime editing" for processing pooled PE screening data and various downstream analyses performed as part of this study.

**read_processing**: Bash scripts were used to split fastqs of pegRNA-ST cassette reads into individual files for each element based on our construct design. Python scripts contain code to derive pegRNA frequencies and ST editing percentages from pre-processed reads.

**downstream_analysis**: Mainly includes scripts used to perform further analysis and figure generation. 

**variant_validation**: Contains scripts for analysis and visualisation of data acquired for variant validation.
